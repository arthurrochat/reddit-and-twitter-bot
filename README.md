# reddit-and-twitter-bot
A Twitter bot that tweets images from a subreddit,
you can see(and follow :P) it working here https://twitter.com/bot_blessimages/

# Installation:

If you wanna to use this, you'll only need to have node.js and php on your computer, then all you need to do is clone the project,
run nmp install, create and configure a .env file with you informations following the .env.example.

# Usage: 

Once your project is properly installed, you may make some changes on the code(i hope you do). Then you can deploy to your server
to run the script you'll need to give the command php rodar.php and your bot will go online.
